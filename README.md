NAME: DIONE ALFRED A. CABIGAS
COURSE AND YEAR: BSIT-3

I am an aspiring computer programmer that wants to hone my skills in programming. I currently have a limited skillsets and pretty much average in all of them. Though it's a bit sad that I am a Jack of All Trades but I do want to at least master one before I can start my career in the industry. I'm not good in the designing part but I am good at the technical side. I am also pretty average in the leadership role.
