NAME: CHARLES DOMINIC HORDISTA
COURSE & YEAR: BSIT-4

My friends call me Chad but Charles is also fine. I am a 4th year BSIT student with 3rd year subjects. Cats are really cute, dogs too. Coding is what motivates me this year. I really like playing survival games. I do outdoor stuff too such as running and gardening.
